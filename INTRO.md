Welcome to LuckyGames and Goodlucktoken! Goodlucktoken is an experimental emoji-based token intended to encourage random acts of kindness and as a currency for games of chance and in the future for rewarding tasks or work on the Tron network.
Right now the opportunities are limited to experiment on the network but in the future, this token's journey from simple association to a good deed and or luck can be distributed and tracked to experiment with various types of risk and reward theories, and the development of games which will be both fun social opportunities and ways to earn more goodluctoken. 

There are many applications that could be explored and researched as decision making, and game theory can be applied in cooperative and competitive situations.

Also we love giving away free tokens and rewarding our fans with random and scheduled raffles and prizes. We have a selection of ready made games offered arcade style in t.me/XPGaming we have raindrops and raffles in t.me/NewLuckCity and we have bots and games and developing the homepage so that our users can have more ways to use Goodlucktoken in multiple contexts, along with seeking placement on an exchange after the tronscan ICO.

Stay tuned as we continue to share drops of TRX, Goodlucktoken and other rewards both directly in drops to voters and in random drawings and prizes for games.

May the Luck be with You.
