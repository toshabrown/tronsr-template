When Representative Awards reach at least 10 trx
80% TRX rewards goes to voters in proportion to their votes relative to all votes.
20% TRX rewards goes to costs associated with prizes awarded in games.

When Trx is received for any game of chance
90% TRX received for gaming purposes remains in game pools or frozen to build the pool's value.
10% TRX recieved for gaming covers tipping and costs associated with bots, such as Seedit.

Any other token recieved as part of Donation, Partnership or other Gifted Tokens
100% are sold or traded to gain more value for growing the community and to use as alternative prizes when TRX is not available.

Donors and voters can recieve approximately .008-1.9 trx in random faucet drops depending on what is recieved, If we become an SR these numbers will increase also if we produce block rewards they will be distributed according to the Representative Award 80-20 split- 80% to voters to 20% to game support.
